## Interactions: Pressures and Resilience

Pressures and resilience layers interact with an indicator to increase or decrease its likely future state. From a management perspective, there are only two ways of increasing the **Likely Future State**: increase resilience measures and/or decrease pressures. Overtime, the effects of these management actions will change the current state of the goal and the trend, resulting in higher scores. This would be most visible through multiple years of engagement with an OHI assessment.

Ecological and social resilience are assessed separately and then combined to determine the goal score. This is usually done with equal weighting, but that could be changed if expert opinion recommended otherwise. All resilience measure are associated with a pressures layer regardless of the weighting, such that any ecological or social pressure has a countervailing resilience measure. Mathematically, this is represented as (r-p), where r=resilience and p=pressures. The Index framework uses this relationship, and the underlying data, to ultimately convey which has a greater incidence over the goal status, the pressures or the resilience.

**The figure below** shows the global assessment stressors by category, and the resilience measures meant to 'balance' (or counteract) them. Note that resilience layers are only available for some categories and goals in the Global case, highlighting the importance of data availability for these layers. Also, some resilience measures are goal-specific; that is, they act on certain goals without counteracting pressures. When you have regulations to improve the practices captured in the status of specific goals (e.g., sustainable tourism, lower bycatch, etc.), you can include them as resilience measures.

![Each resilience data layer should have a corresponding pressures layer, and vice versa. Note that a pressure layer becomes (1-resilience) in cases where only resilience data are available, due to data limitations.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/19ZBIhzTrNlumV9ZhCmsdEcvybFHp-eN5P5IFAsFmql0/pub?w=558&h=721)

Pressures and resilience are ultimately important for scores, but they have a smaller contribution (8.5.% each, 17% total) to the overall scores because we can only approximate their effects. Individual pressures are ranked for their importance to different goals based on published studies and expert opinion. Resilience actions are the best way to improve a score, because they can reduce pressures, protect ocean habitats and species, improve status, and optimize benefits to people.

 Pressures and resilience are usually summarized across ecological and social  categories in order to reveal the influence of any one factor that might be present. In this way, for example, pressures from pollution, habitat destruction, fishing pressure, species pollution, and climate change will have a cumulative impact on the scores.
