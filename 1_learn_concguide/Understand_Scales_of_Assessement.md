## **Understand the scales of assessment**

![Scores are calculated for each region and combined to produce a total score for the study area. Data or indicators are required for every region.](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1RsamVf-p5nSUS8_w--uU5I2717tqMPlhc3JEbW8Rvkg/pub?w=677&h=446)

### The Global assessment and your OHI+

> By conducting a study, you will be developing an Ocean Health Index Independent Assessment (OHI+) at a regional scale. Most OHI+ assessments take place at subnational scales (states, provinces, municipalities) and then are aggregated at a national scale. However, you can implement the OHI methodology at any scale from global, to transboundary regions, to subnational areas.

OHI+ assessments are conducted by independent groups such as yours that use the Index framework to measure ocean health in their own regions, countries, states, and communities. Your OHI+ assessment is different from the Global Assessments because they are meant to fit your local context. The purpose of conducting these independent assessments is that they be used by managers in your area to incorporate information and priorities at the spatial scale where policy and management decisions are made.

The Index framework remains consistent at different scales. Whether at the global level, as in the Global Assessments, or at your more local level, the goal scores are calculated at the scale of the reporting unit, or **region**, and scores are then combined using a weighted average to produce the score for the overall area assessed, called the **study area**.

> In the Global Assessments the **study area** is the world and the **regions** assessed are two hundred twenty coastal countries or territories, Antartica, and the fifteen regions of the High Seas in an even more recent study. At the global scale, the regions are defined by internationally recognized Exclusive Economic Zones. Global assessments are conducted by a multidisciplinary team of scientists led by the U.S. National Center for Ecological Assessment and Synthesis (NCEAS), Conservation International, and the Seas Around Us Project. These studies are published annually and use models developed using the best existing data available at the global scale to capture each goal philosophy (which will be described in later sections of this phase).

#### Comparing Scales of Assessment

> The overarching OHI framework should guide your efforts, but you should determine the data, models, and other inputs that go into your assessment in order to make it more relevant to management in the local context.

It is important to note that the scores from your OHI+ assessment **cannot be compared directly to the scores from Global Assessments or other independent assessments**. Since your goal choices, goal models, and input data and parameters will differ from those employed globally, your methods will be unique to your area, meaning the scores cannot be quantitatively compared. However, you can compare the scores for the same assessment area through time and make truly quantitative comparisons. Understanding this should allow you to be creative as you develop your plans going into your assessment. Nevertheless, it is possible to make qualitative comparisons. For example, although methods may differ between two independent assessments, it is possible to say that *country X* with a score of 80 is closer to its management targets than *country Y* with a score of 65.

> Even in the Global Assessments, the methods are improved every year by increasing the robustness of goal models, integrating new data, and recalculating the scores with the improved methods both for the current year and, retroactively, for previous years to allow for year-to-year comparisons. The scientific objectivity comes from applying the same methods and reference points to all regions equally, which also allows for valid comparison of performance across countries/territories.
