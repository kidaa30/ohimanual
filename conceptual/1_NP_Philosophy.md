## **Natural Products**

> The **Natural Products** goal describes how sustainably people harvest non-food products from the sea.

#### Philosophy

**Natural Products** evaluates the levels of sustainability for all ocean-derived goods that are traded. These include shells, sponges, corals, seaweeds, fish oil, and ornamental fishes, among other things. It does not included products that are consumed for only nutrition, but may in some cases include products that are consumed as medicine. In the Global Assessments, the goal model calculates overall status by weighting the status of sustainable harvest of each extracted marine product by its proportional value relative to other harvested products. Higher scores reflect sustainable extraction of non-food ocean resources with little to no impact on surrounding habitats, marine species, or human well-being.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, quantity, value, and a sustainability rating of the harvest method would be available for every marine and coastally-derived natural product within the regions of a study area. This would include a wide range of products, including corals, shells, seaweeds, aquarium fish, mangrove wood, or any non-food marine product that is harvested within a region. The ideal reference point would be derived from a functional relationship of the sustainability of the harvest for each product relative to the amount of product available in the ecosystem, informed by scientific studies.

#### Keep in Mind

This goal does not include non-living items such as oil, gas, and mining products, because these practices are not considered to be sustainable. They are also done at such relatively large scales that including them would essentially make an index for those sectors specifically. This goal also does not include any valuation of things like bioprospecting for medicines through genetic discoveries, which  has an unpredictable potential value occurring in the future rather than measurable value now.

 The activities that drive this goal can interact with other goals and sub-goals when unsustainable harvesting practices are used. Because so little is known about some of the functions relationships between the amount of natural products taken and the effect of harvest on their quantities in the ecosystem, assumptions often have to be made to set the reference points in the calculations.
