## Team Structure

The Team Structure will largely depend on the goal of conducting an assessment, thus there is no single "right" team requirements for developing an OHI+ assessment. Academic led assessments (such as those led by research labs or for a Ph.D thesis) tend to have fewer people involved. However, most assessments to date have management and/or policy goals, and therefore, have wider stakeholder involvement. Effective assessments are carefully planned and require adequate project leadership and vision. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of the Index, assessments often count with participation of various stakeholder groups. Nevertheless, we recommend a key agency or group assumes the leadership of the assessment to ensure proper planning, development, and engagement throughout the assessment.

However, many successful teams have structured themselves as follows:

1) A Multidisciplinary Working Group:

  The OHI+ working group for your study area should include government agencies, scientific and academic experts, civil society (resource users), and NGOs (social, environmental). By assembling a multidisciplinary working group, you ensure the tasks are evenly divided among the participants, as well counting with a pluralistic system to include various values and perspectives. It is this working group who is responsible for doing the early learning about OHI and developing the Work Plan in Phase 2. The working group also provides important guidance to the technical team in terms of stakeholder engagement, goal weighing, reference points, and ensuring the study is aligning with management and policy needs. Lastly, the working group actively engages with key stakeholders and decision-makers through the process and after assessments are conducted to develop action plans that integrate the findings of the study into management and policy interventions.

2) A Technical Team

  The success of your OHI+ assessment process will depend on the effectiveness of your technical team. While every assessment will be done differently--it is always done according to local needs, resources, and priorities--we can provide guidance on the skills required within your team and how other assessments have structured their teams. Team sizes have ranged from two to ten people depending on the scope of the study and the qualifications/skills of the team, particularly the technical members. Whether members work full-time or part-time will also affect the time required to completed the assessment.

  It is best to assemble a small core team of skilled, flexible people. Because OHI assessments combine knowledge from multiple disciplines, require developing models and setting reference points, and use innovative, evolving open-source tools, team members will likely be required to work outside of their direct expertise and technical ability and must feel comfortable and have the authority to do so. One approach that has worked well has been to assemble a core team that is very knowledgeable about the OHI framework and process, with specific members having backgrounds in marine science and tasked with information gathering and communication or with information processing and the Toolbox (or better yet, a combination of the two). This core team then engages additional ‘goal keepers’ that are experts in specific OHI goals to help develop the best models, access information, identify pressures and resilience measures, and set reference points, through in-person meetings, workshops, and remote communication.

  There are a few requirements.

  - The technical team members need to be skilled in the programming language R.
  - Setting regional boundaries and spatial analysis requires access to GIS software (some of this can be done in R).

The OHI team can offer in-kind support (scientific, managerial, and communications), but for local technical information and support, you will require dedicated specialists. <!---From FAQ, ECU workshop 2015--->
