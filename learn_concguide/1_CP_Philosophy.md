## **Coastal Protection**

> **Coastal Protection** describes the condition and extent of habitats that protect the coasts against storm waves and flooding. It measures the area they currently cover relative to the area they covered in the recent past.

#### Philosophy

Many habitats, including coral reefs, mangroves, seagrasses, salt marshes, and sea ice, act as natural buffers against storm damage and erosion. By protecting against incoming waves, flooding, and and other erosive factors, these living habitats keep people safe and can help mitigate economic loss of personal and public property, cultural landmarks, and natural resources. The **Coastal Protection** goal assesses the amount of protection provided by marine and coastal habitats by measuring the area they cover now relative to the area they covered in the recent past.

#### Ideal Approach

Ideally, data for all habitats within regions of a study area would be available, as well as information on the value of the land and the vulnerability of inhabitants being protected by these habitats. This would require data for each habitat type at a high spatial resolution as well as a measure of the value of what is protected by the habitats. The reference point for habitat-based goals will likely be a temporal baseline and historic data would be needed such that current habitat and value data can be compared to them.

#### Keep in Mind

The Global studies did not include an assessment of the protection afforded by human-made structures such as jetties and seawalls, because these structures cannot be preserved without maintenance and do not constitute long-term sustainable services. They may also have other undesirable side effects such as the altering of sedimentation rates causing erosion in new and unexpected locations. Although this phenomenon is closely tied to human habitation, it does not account for such things as property values as indicators but rather it focuses on what the habitats actually are and the protection that they provide.
