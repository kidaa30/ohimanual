# Introduction

The phases in this site are designed to build your capacity to autonomously develop an assessment. The information is organized along the four interdependent phases of an OHI+ assessment:

# A brief introduction to the Ocean Health Index

- **Phase 1 Learn about OHI**: understand the philosophy and conceptual underpinnings of the Ocean Health Index framework and establish the motivation for conducting your study
- **Phase 2 Plan an OHI+ Assessment**: develop a robust project action plan or proposal, detailing your objectives, activities, resources needed (human and financial), and timeline
- **Phase 3 Conduct the OH+ Assessment**: engage with the science, find data and indicators, modify goal models, and use the Ocean Health Index Toolbox to synthesize information, modify parameters, establish targets, and calculate scores
- **Phase 4 Communicate and Inform Decision Making**: engage key stakeholders to interpret findings and identify priority themes and areas for management intervention

> Note: The amount of time required to do an OHI+ Assessment will vary depending on local processes. The first assessment for your region will certainly take the longest since you will have to establish many parameters, but updates can be done faster as new information becomes available. **The first OHI+ assessment may take from 9-18 months depending on local conditions.** Future assessments are much simpler since they only involve updating information and data. However, creating the enabling conditions for an assessment might take longer. By enabling conditions we refer to local capacity, political willingness and stability, organizational development, etc.

Following the steps in this site will allow you to create and use an OHI+ assessment as a decision-support tool, monitor the status and trends of all ocean and coastal elements (ecological, economic, social, and physical), and understand the consequences of management and policy interventions.

The Index integrates information (data and indicators) from various fields into a single framework and offers various metrics to allow decision-makers to determine the appropriate balance of priorities among multiple uses to ensure that oceans can continue to sustainably deliver a range of benefits and services to people now and in the future. The framework also allows users to better understand the cumulative pressures and resilience factors affecting, both negatively and positively, the status of various ocean elements. By synthesizing all of these parameters in a single framework, the Index offers users a comprehensive and integrated view of marine systems as a way to understand the trade-offs and synergies among various goals.

## How to use this site: the Task Timeline

When conducting an assessment, is it useful to use our timeline as a guide, knowing that the amount of time required to do an assessment will vary. This site is structured around the OHI+ Task Timeline, which defines the tasks involved in each phase. When conducting an assessment, the OHI+ Task Timeline is useful as a guide and roadmap since was created based in the experiences of past and ongoing projects. However, there are many pathways to achieve the same outcome, so this process is strongly recommended, but not mandatory. Do notice, however, that the **process of conducing an OHI+ assessment is not necessarily a linear one**, that is, many tasks take place throughout multiple phases, or require you to adapt and redefine elements throughout the process as there is a lot of iteration and discussion among the team to arrive at the best decisions. We encourage you to use the Task Timeline along with this site to understand where you are along the process of your assessment and to ensure you are not missing any steps. It is important to keep in mind that the process of conducting the assessment requires collaboration and iteration among your team to arrive at the best results possible. The process of conducting an assessment is a scientific one and good documentation to track the decision-making along the way will support the validity of the results.

The Task Timeline shows the steps recommended in conducting Ocean Health Index assessments. It gives an overview of the **Phases** of the project and the colors offer recommendations for the types of skills needed at different stages of the process. The amount of time actually required required to do an assessment will vary depend on a number of factors, such as the ease of data access and the number of people working on the assessment. The process may be slowed by unforeseen challenges such as technical issues with software and dead-ends in the data search, among other things.

The team will usually consist of scientists, programmers, and a core management team (or working group), who must all work together to produce the results. For example, gathering appropriate data for each status, pressure, and resilience layer requires serious thinking about how to calculate reference points while at the same time as determining the validity and usability of the datasets.

It is expected that your data sources and goal models will change during the process, and this is entirely normal. The process of conducting an assessment is a scientific one and good documentation to track the decision-making will support the validity of the results. In fact, many careful considerations must made even before using the OHI tools such as the Toolbox and WebApp (see **Phase Three**.)
